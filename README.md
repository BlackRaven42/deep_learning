Back Propagation Method
Here you can find:
* Source code (.cpp and .h - files, and also project & solution - files for MSVS2015)
* Report about job has been done (BackPropagation.pdf) 
* Data with train & test samples (data.zip)

To build executables for your platform (win32, win64 are only supported) you should open .sln file in Visual Studio and build the solution.
And then you can run (to see all the keys available, type "-h" into the command line).

Note: To test application with the data attached, you need first to unpack data into the same directory as executables are placed.
